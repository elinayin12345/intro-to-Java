## Intro to Java
A Java program can be characterized as an **object** represented in a **class**
Currently our program has a *Main* object. Inside of this object we have the *Main* calss.

## Output
In Java to output an item to the console we use: 'System o
## Comments


A comment is used as user annotation with the purpose of being human readable.

**Line Comments** follow double backslashes. `//`

**Block Comments** are contained within `/* Comments */`

## Identifers

In Java use the term **identifer** to describe a variable, parameter, constant, user-defined calss. 


-cannot begin with digit
-Can only contain letters, digits, and underscores
-Case sensitive `age != Age` ( age is not equal to Age)

*Note: *
- class name starts with a capital letter
- rese5red words are entirely lowercase and may not be used as identifiers ( Reserved words will show up in blue.)

## Types 
**Primitive** or **built-in** types in Java are 
- `int` An integer
- `boolean` True or False (boolean shirtColor = true)
- `double` floating-point number (2.73) (compared to float in Python)
- `char` sinfel characterized

*Note: *Integers have a fixed amount of memory, so there is a limit to how many digits you can store(2^31 -1) 

## Variables
Variablews are a type of indentifier that stores a value of a specific type

we can create variables using **declaration**
- `int age;`
-`double x, y
